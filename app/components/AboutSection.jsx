          <p>
          Hey there, I'm Yong Qin, a fusion of aerospace engineering finesse and tech wizardry. Armed with a Master's in Computer Science and a Bachelor's with Honors in Aerospace Engineering, I'm a formidable force. My journey highlights my talent for optimizing systems, slashing code duplication, and crafting stellar user experiences. Fluent in languages like JavaScript and Python, I thrive in frameworks like React and Spring Boot. And when I'm not coding, you'll find me throwing punches in Muay Thai or grappling on the mats in Judo â€“ a coder with a kick!
